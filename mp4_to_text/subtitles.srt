1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,200
The question is, if you get a cloth dripping wet without gravity and you ring it out, what's

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,200
going to happen?

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,800
What will happen to a wrung out cloth?

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
So, and had to use equipment that was here on board the space station.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,800
We might have the coolest washcloths ever here on the space station.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,440
I'm going to show you.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,040
This is one of our washcloths.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,600
And it's packed in.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,000
It's put down into this little tiny hockey puck so that it saves space.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,000
When you open up a hockey puck and you pull out your washcloth, this is the one I'm going

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,200
to use for the experiment today.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,360
And so when you open up your hockey puck and turn it into a washcloth, it was compressed

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,200
in a great big vice somewhere.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,800
Okay, so here's my washcloth, like a magic trick.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,580
And now I'm going to get this soaking wet and then we're going to see what will happen

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,400
when we wring it out.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,480
Meredith and Kendra suggested that I dip this in a bag, but bags don't hold water in

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
space.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,160
So instead, I filled a water bag.

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,480
This has drinking water in it.

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:35,600
And I'm going to squirt a bunch of water into this washcloth.

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:50,880
Okay, so here's a soaking wet washcloth.

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Get the microphones.

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,200
You can hear me while I'm talking.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,440
And now let's start wringing it out.

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,280
It's really wet.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:20,560
Let's be coming up to the water.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,840
The water is all over my hands.

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,160
In fact, it rings out of the cloth into my hands.

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:32,760
And if I let go of the cloth carefully, the water sort of has it stick to my hand.

31
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,280
Okay, so the experiment worked beautifully.

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,040
And the answer to the question is the water squeezes out of the cloth.

33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,280
And then because of the surface tension of the water, it actually runs along the surface

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,200
of the cloth and then up into my hand, almost like you had jello on your hands or gel on

35
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
your hand.

36
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,440
And it'll just stay there.

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,440
Wonderful moisturizer on my hands.

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,420
And the cloth doesn't really unravel itself.

39
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,300
It just stays there floating like a dog's chew toy, soaking wet.

40
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,860
Great experiment, worked perfectly.

41
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,820
Meredith and Kendra, congratulations.

42
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,260
Great idea.
